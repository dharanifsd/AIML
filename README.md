## Introduction
With the increasing complexity and criticality of power supply systems, the ability to predict and prevent faults is crucial to ensure continuous and reliable operation. Traditional methods of fault detection often rely on manual inspection or basic threshold-based alarms, which may not be sufficient for early detection of potential issues. In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model capable of identifying potential faults in power supply units.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of historical data collected from various power supply units. It includes parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, and load conditions recorded at regular intervals. Additionally, the dataset contains labels indicating whether a fault occurred during each observation period.

## Methods
### Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is known for its effectiveness in classification tasks, especially when dealing with large datasets.

### Decision Tree Algorithm
Decision Trees are a popular machine learning technique for classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the feature space into subsets based on the value of input features. Decision Trees are interpretable and can handle both numerical and categorical data, making them suitable for fault prediction tasks.

## Implementation
We implemented the Naive Bayes Classifier and Decision Tree Algorithm using Python programming language and popular libraries such as scikit-learn. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and normalized before training the models. Cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Results
The performance of the Naive Bayes Classifier and Decision Tree Algorithm was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches in predicting faults in power supply units. Decision Tree Algorithm achieved higher accuracy compared to Naive Bayes Classifier, indicating its suitability for this application.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms for fault prediction in power supply systems. Both Naive Bayes Classifier and Decision Tree Algorithm show promising results in identifying potential faults based on input parameters. Future research could explore more advanced machine learning techniques and incorporate real-time monitoring for proactive fault detection.

## Future Work
Future work in this area could focus on:
- Exploring ensemble learning techniques to further improve fault prediction accuracy.
- Integrating additional features such as environmental conditions and maintenance history.
- Deploying the predictive model in real-world power supply systems for continuous monitoring and preventive maintenance.
